# A Study of Oil Pump based on Control Charts

## Abstract :
This project introduces the application of the study of oil pumps in automobiles. It underscores
the pivotal role of statistical methods in scrutinizing pump performance, formulating optimal
maintenance strategies, and enhancing overall efficiency in automotive oil extraction
operations. The paper elucidates how statistical analysis can provide valuable insights into the
functioning of oil pumps, thereby facilitating data-driven decision-making in automotive
engineering. By leveraging statistical tools, the paper demonstrates how we can not only predict
and prevent potential failures but also extend the lifespan of oil pumps and improve the
efficiency of automobiles. The findings of this project have significant implications for oil
pump management and the broader field of automotive engineering.
